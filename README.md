# Car-Price-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning-
This dataset contains information about used cars listed on www.cardekho.com This data can be used for a lot of purposes such as price prediction to exemplify the use of  different types of machine learning(Pegression ) models for eg Linear Regression , Logistic Regression ,Random Forest Model. In this project  i have used Random Forest model to perform the predictions . The python libraries used for this project are mentioned in the "Requirement.txt" file.  this is an end to  end project which is deployed using flask framework and hosted using "Heroku" platform . The independent features on which the predictions are are performed are name, year, selling_price,km_driven, fuel, seller_type, transmission, Owner. The categorical features are converted into intigers using "One Hot Encoding".In this project  i have done feature enginerring by performing correlation between features to  check  which features has more important to give a better accuracy .i have also used hyper paramatric tuning to check which parameters are suitable enough to give the best accuracy
